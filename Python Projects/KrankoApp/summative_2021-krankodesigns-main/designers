##Child Class
# This class inherits from Developers, which also inherits from the parent class KrankoDesigns. It will therefore have access to the methods from KrankoDesigns and Developers. There is a take a loan method defined here that overides those from the classes it is inheriting.

class Designers(Developers):

	Initialize the unique ID that will be assigned to an accountant  as Unique ID
Code = 800

super().__init__(fName,lName,password,dob,phone_no,doj,acc,specialty,years_of_experience,rate,available,portfolio_link)

def take_a_loan(self):
		If doj - today <90 days:
			Reject loan request.
			print(“You can only borrow after being a member of KrankoDesigns for 3months”)
			Take them to main menu
		elif  doj - today >= 90 days:
			Ask user to enter amt
			Exception handling of value error
			##Designers can only borrow a maximum of $11000
			If amount > 11000
				print(“Request is out of range. Can only borrow $11000”)
				Back to main menu
			Elif amount > amount in KrankoDesigns account:
				print(amount not available. Try the process again with a lower amount)
				Back to main menu
			else:
Add said amount to self.acc
deduct amount from KrankoDesigns account:
print(operation successful. You have borrowed {amt}’)
Take user to main menu

Import unittest
Import Designer's class if in another file.
->def Test_hiring_developer()
This would test whether the hiring_developer method is working properly,
 We would first create sample objects and then test  the method using them
-->def Test_hiring_accountant
This would test whether the hiring_developer method is working correctly
This would be implemented by creating sample objects and test using them.
→ def Test_hiring_architect
This would test whether the hiring_architect method is working correctly
This would be implemented by creating sample objects and test using them.
-->def Test_buying_software
This would test whether the buying_software method is working correctly
This would be implemented by creating sample objects and test using them.
-->def Test_calc_tax
This would test whether the calc_taxr method is working correctly
This would be implemented by creating sample objects and test using them.


-->Def  Test_take a loan()
This would test the take_a loan method, by first creating a sample object then checking if Krankodesigns has any money to lend, and if yes,then check if the amount borrowed is less than what Krankodesigns has and if the conditions are met,the designer is granted a loan.This involves checking whether borrowing beyond the limit will be allowed., if the money will be credited to the user’s account and debited from KrankoDesigns account


→ Def Test_take_ a leave
This would test the take_a_leave method, by temporarily scraping the designerst's name off the operating dictionary until the developer comes back. A sample object would be used to test it.

-->Def Test_terminate_contract
This would test the terminate contract method, by permanently scraping off the designer's name in the operating dictionary. A sample object would be used to test this.
