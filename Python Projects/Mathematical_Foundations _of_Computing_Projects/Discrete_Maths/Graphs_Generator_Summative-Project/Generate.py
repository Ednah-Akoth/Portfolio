#           to them if it is not checked yetm in order to check the array, read it and append the correct string to the list.
# 
#           The first_component function is responciple in checking each array and generating the right string

#           arrays in a specific connected graph, and the second one works in checking and processing the 
#           temporary graphs (Please read about our algorithms to understand this)
